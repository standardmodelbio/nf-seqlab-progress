# nf-seqlab-progress

## Summary

`nf-seqlab-progress` is a Nextflow plugin scaffolded from the official plugin
template. Out of the box it provides:

- A custom function `sayHello` that can be imported into Nextflow scripts.
- A workflow observer that reacts to pipeline lifecycle events (start and
  completion).

Replace this section with a description of what your plugin actually does.

Note: The **Summary**, **Get Started**, **Examples**, and **License** sections are
mandatory: they are required by the Nextflow Registry, which uses this
file as the plugin description. The **Plugin development** section below is
guidance for working on the plugin and can be removed before publishing.

## Get Started

Enable the plugin in your pipeline `nextflow.config`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'nf-seqlab-progress@0.1.0'
}
```

Nextflow downloads the plugin from the Nextflow Registry the first time
the pipeline runs.

## Examples

Import and call the `sayHello` function from a Nextflow script:

```nextflow
include { sayHello } from 'plugin/nf-seqlab-progress'

workflow {
    channel.of('Mundo', 'World').map { target -> sayHello(target) }
}
```

The bundled observer prints a message when the pipeline starts and completes,
so running any pipeline with the plugin enabled produces:

```
Pipeline is starting! 🚀
Pipeline complete! 👋
```

## Plugin development

This project was created from the [Nextflow plugin template](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/guides/gradle-plugin.html#gradle-plugin-create).

### Building

To build the plugin:

```bash
make assemble
```

### Testing with Nextflow

The plugin can be tested without a local Nextflow installation:

1. Build and install the plugin to your local Nextflow installation: `make install`
2. Run a pipeline with the plugin: `nextflow run hello -plugins nf-seqlab-progress@0.1.0`

### Publishing

Plugins can be published to a central Nextflow registry to make them accessible to the Nextflow community.

Follow these steps to publish the plugin to the Nextflow Registry:

1. Create a file named `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`, where `$HOME` is your home directory. Add the following properties:
    * `npr.apiKey`: Your Nextflow Registry access token.
2. Package your plugin and publish it to the registry: `make release`.

## License

Apache License 2.0. See the [`COPYING`](COPYING) file for details.

Note: The above license is given for guidance only; however the Nextflow Registry
requires the plugin to include an OSS (open source software) license.
